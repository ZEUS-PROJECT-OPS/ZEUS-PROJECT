<h1 align="center">⚡  ZEUS-PROJECT-OPS Security Tools ⚡</h1>

Welcome to the official repository of **ZEUS-PROJECT-OPS**. This repository contains a collection of tools, scripts, and materials focused on cybersecurity—specifically offensive and defensive security techniques.
ZEUS-PROJECT-OPS is an elite cyber operations unit focused on the development, deployment, and mastery of zero-day exploits. Designed to operate in the shadows, the team executes high-level missions with military precision and algorithmic sophistication.

Based on intelligence, reverse engineering, and digital infiltration tactics, ZEUS-PROJECT-OPS doesn’t just look for openings — they create entry points before defenses are even in place.

This isn’t just hacking — this is surgical cyber warfare.
